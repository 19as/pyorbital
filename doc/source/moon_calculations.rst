Moon phase and position
=======================

It is possibe to calculate the phase and position of the moon and any given
time in the past or future. This is done by an implementation of the
astronimical methods described at Stjaernhimlen_. The calculations have been
compared to the pyephem library, and deviations are small, see below.
